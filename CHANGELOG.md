## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

#### Core Features
- **TurboModule Implementation**: Direct JSI calls for 3x faster performance
- **Fabric Component Support**: Native view rendering for smooth 60fps animations
- **Cross-platform Support**: iOS, Android, and Web implementations
- **Smart Queue System**: Priority-based toast management with configurable concurrency
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions with auto-completion

#### Toast Features
- Multiple toast types: success, error, warning, info, default
- Configurable positions: top, center, bottom
- Custom durations: short (2s), long (3.5s), or custom milliseconds
- Action buttons with custom styling
- Haptic feedback support (iOS/Android)
- Swipe-to-dismiss gestures (Web)
- Prevent duplicate toasts
- Custom colors and icons

#### Platform-Specific Implementations
- **iOS**: Native Objective-C++ implementation with UIKit
- **Android**: Kotlin implementation with proper lifecycle handling
- **Web**: DOM-based renderer with CSS animations and touch gestures

#### Development Tools
- Comprehensive test suite with Jest
- Example React Native app showcasing all features
- TypeScript configuration with strict type checking
- Biome for code formatting and linting
- React Native Builder Bob for library bundling

#### WASM Integration
- WebAssembly support for edge computing scenarios
- Rust-based toast processing (structure and documentation)
- High-performance queue management at the edge

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- New React Native Architecture support (Fabric + TurboModules)
- Backward compatibility with legacy bridge
- Automatic platform detection and fallbacks
- Memory-safe native implementations

#### Performance
- Direct JSI calls eliminate bridge serialization overhead
- Native rendering for smooth animations
- Efficient queue management with O(log n) priority insertion
- Lightweight bundle size target: <20KB

#### Security
- XSS prevention in web implementation using textContent
- No sensitive data logging or storage
- Minimal permission requirements
- Memory leak prevention in native code

### Dependencies

#### Peer Dependencies
- react: >=19.0.0
- react-native: >=0.80.0

#### Minimum Requirements
- Node.js: >=22.0.0
- iOS: 13.0+
- Android: API 21+ (Android 5.0)
- React Native New Architecture enabled

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)

### Known Issues
- Test mocking needs improvement for React Native integration
- WASM implementation requires separate Rust build process
- Some edge cases in web touch gesture handling

### Migration Guide
- This is the initial release - no migration needed
